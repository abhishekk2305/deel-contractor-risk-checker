Thanks. Please post live evidence and then prep deployment.

Live proofs (paste outputs)

GET /health showing providers:{sanctions:"opensanctions", media:"newsapi"}, build_sha, db/redis/s3:true.

Example risk check

POST /api/risk-check request body you used.

Full JSON response including sanctions.hits_count, lists, top_matches, partial_sources (should be empty), score, tier, ruleset_version.

Countries

GET /api/countries?page=1&page_size=50 → total should be ~249.

GET /api/countries?query=Côte → show diacritic search working.

PDF

POST /api/pdf-report 202 job_id → poll result with pre‑signed URL. Attach the generated PDF and confirm it lists “Sanctions source: OpenSanctions (live)” and formats numbers to two decimals and dates like “Aug 14, 2025.”

Admin

Create/edit/publish a rule for a sample country; paste responses and the new ruleset_versions row; show the corresponding audit_log entry.

Rate limits, retries, and caching

Show the timeout/retry settings for OpenSanctions and NewsAPI.

Demonstrate request de‑duplication: same query within 30–60s returns from cache; show Redis key format and a log excerpt.

Verification pack

Update /verification with:

seed.sql (full ISO‑3166 insert), curl scripts + sample responses (including OpenSanctions search), one sample PDF, a short GIF of the end‑to‑end flow, README with exact steps to reproduce on the public preview.

Deployment prep

Configure Deploys (Always On) for frontend, api, rules-engine, worker.

Post required env vars per service (mask secrets).

Provide the runbook:

Deploy and rollback steps

API_JWT_SECRET rotation steps

Post‑deploy checklist: health, countries total≈249, live risk check success, PDF generated, admin publish works, analytics counters increment.

Nice polish before go‑live

“How scoring works” modal: show weights, thresholds, ruleset_version, and data sources (OpenSanctions + NewsAPI).

Settings page: diagnostics button runs /health and shows green checks for DB/Redis/S3/providers.

Ensure 2‑decimal formatting everywhere (dashboard, country pages, PDFs).

Once you post the proofs and public preview URL, I’ll run the flow end‑to‑end and give the go‑ahead to deploy.
