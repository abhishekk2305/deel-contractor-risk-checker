Fix PDF Download—Detailed Debugging and Completion Prompt

You must fully resolve the critical bug where PDF reports do not download after the user clicks “Generate PDF” on a risk assessment, even though the UI says “your PDF is ready.” The fix must be tested and proven in the live preview accessible by the user.

Follow these steps and provide proof for each:

Backend Investigation

Check that POST /api/pdf-report is called when the user clicks “Generate PDF” and that it returns a 202 response with { job_id }.

Confirm that the background job actually completes:

Poll GET /api/pdf-report/:job_id until you get a response with a working URL and file size in { url, size_bytes }.

S3/Storage

Verify that the PDF file is actually being generated and stored.

Check S3 (or your storage) to confirm the file appears with the filename and time that match the request.

Ensure that the returned URL is a real, accessible, pre-signed link.

Frontend Behavior

The client must poll the job endpoint and, when ready, activate the download link and/or auto-open the PDF in a new browser tab.

If the file is ready, clicking “Download PDF” (or auto-triggered) must initiate the browser download dialog and save a file.

UI Feedback

Show progress/loading if the job is running; when the PDF is ready, display an explicit "Download your PDF" link or trigger.

If errors occur (job fails, URL missing), show a user-visible error—not just a silent fail.

Proof Required

Post screenshots or a brief GIF from the live preview showing:

(a) Risk assessment completion

(b) “Generate PDF” clicked

(c) Visual confirmation that PDF appears/downloads in the browser

(d) The actual PDF opened and readable

(e) The corresponding S3 or backend log showing file creation and serving

Also, paste the actual JSON returned from both the job trigger and final poll endpoints.

Do NOT report the issue as fixed unless all the above steps are verified in my preview.
If you encounter errors at any step, paste the full stack trace, error message, or failed API response so we can diagnose together.

I expect to see (1) the end-to-end PDF flow working from my preview, and (2) evidence that a valid PDF is being generated and downloaded reliably. Only then should this issue be marked as resolved.
