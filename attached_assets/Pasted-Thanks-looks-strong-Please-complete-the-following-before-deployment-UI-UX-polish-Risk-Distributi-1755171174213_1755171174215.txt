Thanks—looks strong. Please complete the following before deployment:

UI/UX polish

Risk Distribution cards: format numeric values to two decimals (e.g., 3.60, 1.80, 0.60). Use a formatter utility with locale-aware rounding and trailing zeroes, not string truncation. Apply the same to any score/tier visualizations.

Country cards and tables: ensure Last Updated shows a human-friendly format (e.g., “Aug 14, 2025”).

Risk badge ARIA labels: announce “Risk level: High/Medium/Low” for screen readers.

Empty/partial states:

If partial_sources not empty, show the amber banner with a short “Some data sources timed out; results may be partial” message and an info link.

Add “No results” state for search with a Reset Filters button.

Data completeness

Seed at least 30 countries (target list: US, CA, UK, DE, FR, NL, ES, IT, SE, NO, DK, IE, PL, PT, SG, IN, AU, NZ, JP, KR, CN, HK, TW, AE, SA, BR, MX, AR, CL, ZA) with last_updated and minimal compliance rules, so the demo looks full.

Ensure ruleset_versions exist for minimum 5 countries to demonstrate versioning.

Scoring transparency

Add a small “How scoring works” modal on Risk Check Results with:

Current weights, tier thresholds, ruleset_version, and the list of contributing sources (and which ones were partial).

Include the same footer in the generated PDF.

Analytics and monitoring

Confirm Plausible events fire for search_submit, country_view, risk_check_success, pdf_generate, pdf_download_success, admin_rule_publish.

Expose /metrics for Prometheus with request_count and duration histograms by route.

/health should include build SHA and a quick DB/Redis/S3 check.

Security and limits

Confirm Helmet/CSP, strict CORS (frontend origin only), JWT RBAC on admin routes.

Prove idempotency: same Idempotency-Key on /api/risk-check returns the cached result.

Rate limit: show 429 with Retry-After header when exceeded.

Mask PII in logs; ensure email (if ever captured) is hashed or omitted.

Artifacts

Add a /verification folder with:

curl scripts + sample responses for all endpoints.

Seed SQL and migration files.

One generated PDF sample.

Screenshot(s) of the partial_sources banner.

Sentry test error ID and an uptime check URL.

Deployment prep

Provide a step-by-step deploy runbook:

Required env vars per service (list, mask secrets).

Rolling deploy steps and rollback procedure for each Repl.

Post-deploy verification checklist (health checks, metrics, sample risk check, PDF).

If possible, set custom domain for frontend and confirm SSL.

Optional improvements (nice-to-have)

Add GET /api/risk-check/:id to retrieve historical results.

Admin diff view: highlight added/removed/changed rule text between versions.

CSV export of analytics for a selected date range.

Please implement the above, post before/after screenshots for the UI number formatting and partial banner, and share the public preview URL where I can run the flow end-to-end.

Notes on the vague numbers

The Risk Distribution cards currently show excessive decimal precision. Use a shared numberFormat utility:

formatScore(n: number) => n.toLocaleString(undefined, { minimumFractionDigits: 2, maximumFractionDigits: 2 })

Apply consistently across the dashboard and PDF.
