Stop status reports. My preview still has the same errors. Either fix the actual preview I see or roll back and push a working commit that does. Deliver the following within one update. Do not reply without these exact artifacts.

Non‑negotiable acceptance package from MY preview

Live screen recording from my preview URL

One GIF (2–3 min) recorded from my .replit.dev URL showing:
a) Home: Popular Countries with counts and tooltip “Ranked by searches in last 7 days”
b) Search “Côte” and “Cote” → Côte d’Ivoire appears
c) Risk Assessment: click “Use test data” → John Smith (US) → result renders; open “How scoring works”; click Generate PDF → auto-download opens the file
d) Risk Assessment: “Use test data” → Vladimir Putin (RU) → result renders with sanctions hits
e) Admin: open without 404; create → edit → publish a rule; Version history shows the new version
f) Analytics: counters increment and chart updates after the above actions

Save at verification/demo.gif and link it.

Side-by-side screenshots (before/after) from my preview URL

Home Popular Countries card (with counts)

Admin page (no 404, rule list visible)

Risk result page with the scoring modal open

PDF success toast and a browser tab downloading the PDF

Raw JSON from the same run
Paste the exact responses you triggered during the GIF:

GET /health

GET /api/analytics

GET /api/countries/popular?window=7d&limit=6

GET /api/countries?query=Côte and ?query=Cote

POST /api/risk-check (John Smith) full JSON

POST /api/risk-check (Vladimir Putin) full JSON

POST /api/pdf-report → 202 {job_id}

GET /api/pdf-report/:job_id → {url,size_bytes,expires_at}

Include the two pre-signed URLs; one must match the PDF you add to /verification.

Working PDF committed

Save the exact file you downloaded in the GIF as verification/sample.pdf and link it.

Fixes visible in my preview (commit)

Push code so my preview shows:

Popular Countries ranked by last 7 days searches with counts and tooltip

No duplicate nav; clean breadcrumbs

Admin never 404; Settings has diagnostics (build SHA, ruleset version, DB/Redis/S3/providers)

“Use test data” buttons on the assessment form

“How scoring works” modal with weights, thresholds, sources; same info in the PDF footer

Zero React runtime overlays

Paste the commit SHA and list of files changed.

If you cannot produce the above from MY preview:

Roll back to the last working commit, push, restart, and explain root cause (e.g., edits running in a hidden tab/not committed). Then complete the acceptance package.

Important: Do not respond again with summaries. Only respond with:

Links to verification/demo.gif and verification/sample.pdf

The side-by-side screenshots

The raw JSON blob

The commit SHA

A one-line confirmation that I can refresh the preview and see the same behavior

I will refresh and verify. If any step fails, paste the error and the code diff you applied to fix it.
