Escalation: Do not post summaries. My preview still shows the same issues. I need verifiable, side-by-side evidence from MY running preview URL. Deliverables below are mandatory. If you cannot produce them, roll back any local-only changes and push a working commit that updates my preview.

Hard requirements — deliver within one update:

Side-by-side proof screenshots

Provide two screenshots captured seconds apart:

A: My current preview URL visible in the browser chrome (the .replit.dev URL) showing the before state.

B: The same URL after your fixes showing the after state.

Screens must include the browser address bar with the identical URL, the element being fixed (e.g., Popular Countries ranks with counts, Admin page without 404, Generate PDF → Download button active), and the system clock in the OS tray if possible.

Click-through GIF from my preview

A short screen recording (GIF) from my preview that shows:

Home: Popular Countries with counts and tooltip.

Search → select a country.

Risk Assessment with “Use test data” buttons → run John Smith (US) and Vladimir Putin (RU).

“How scoring works” modal.

Generate PDF → poll → auto Download opening the file.

Admin: open without 404, create/edit/publish a rule → version history updates.

Analytics: numbers increment after your actions.

Put this GIF in /verification/demo.gif and link it.

Live JSON captured from my preview actions

Paste the exact API responses you triggered during the GIF recording:

GET /health

GET /api/analytics

GET /api/countries?query=Côte and ?query=Cote

GET /api/popular-countries (or the endpoint you implemented), including counts and time window used

POST /api/risk-check (both cases) full JSON including providerInfo

POST /api/pdf-report → 202 with job_id and GET /api/pdf-report/:id → {url,size_bytes}

These must match the UI you just recorded.

Working sample.pdf

The exact PDF downloaded in the GIF must be added to /verification/sample.pdf in the repo. Link it.

Commit and deploy the fixes

Push code changes so that when I refresh my preview I see the new behavior. Paste the commit SHA and a list of files changed.

If you cannot reproduce in my preview

Stop development: push the current working code to the repo, restart the App, and ensure my preview reflects it.

Provide a written root cause analysis of why your earlier “proofs” didn’t appear in my preview (e.g., ran in a hidden tab, didn’t push, cached build). Fix your workflow to always update my preview.

Acceptance criteria — no exceptions

My preview reflects: popular countries with counts and tooltip, no duplicate nav, admin no 404, settings diagnostics populated, risk scoring modal present, PDF generation and download works, analytics updates, no React overlays.

I can repeat your GIF steps and see identical results.

Do not reply with “working” until you attach the side-by-side screenshots, the GIF, the raw JSONs, and the sample.pdf from the same run, and I can refresh and see the same in my preview.
