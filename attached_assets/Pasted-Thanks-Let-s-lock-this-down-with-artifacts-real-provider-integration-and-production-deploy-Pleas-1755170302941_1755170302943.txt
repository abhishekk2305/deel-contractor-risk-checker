Thanks. Let’s lock this down with artifacts, real provider integration, and production deploy. Please:

Export verification artifacts

Post a gist or repo folder “/verification” containing:

SQL: schema + seed files used.

cURL scripts for each API with sample requests/responses.

Screenshots/PDF sample from the generated report.

Log excerpts showing rate-limit 429 and idempotency working.

Sentry event link/ID for the forced test error.

List of environment variables with which ones are set (mask secrets).

Show live evidence in console

Print SELECT counts from all tables and the last 5 rows of audit_logs.

Print the exact risk-check response for “John Smith” (JSON).

Print the PDF report record (id, size_bytes, s3_url truncated) and confirm the pre-signed URL downloads.

Wire at least one real external provider (keep adapters swappable)

Sanctions/PEP: enable ComplyAdvantage sandbox. Log provider=complyadvantage and show a real API call sample (redact keys).

Adverse media: enable NewsAPI (or GDELT) and include its contribution in the score. Show partial_sources behavior by simulating a timeout.

Keep FEATURE flags:

FEATURE_SANCTIONS_PROVIDER=mock|complyadvantage

FEATURE_MEDIA_PROVIDER=mock|newsapi

Hardening and SLOs

Add health endpoints returning build git SHA and ruleset_version.

Add OpenAPI/Swagger for /api and /rules-engine.

Add Prometheus-style metrics for request_count and request_duration_seconds by route.

Configure alerts: p95 > 2s and error rate > 2% → log warning.

Confirm Helmet/CSP/CORS headers in responses (paste sample headers).

Production deploy plan

Prepare Deploys for 4 Repls (frontend, api, rules-engine, worker) with “Always On.”

Provide a checklist and runbook:

Required env vars for each service

Rotation procedure for API_JWT_SECRET

Backup/restore steps for Postgres

Rollback steps for each service

Custom domain: set up and share DNS records needed for the frontend (optional now).

Demo script and video

Execute the scripted flow end-to-end (search → detail → risk-check → PDF → admin publish → analytics update).

Record a short demo (or provide an exported GIF) and place it in /verification.

Nice-to-haves (if time permits)

Add GET /api/risk-check/:id to fetch historical results.

Add diff view in Admin for rule versions (before/after highlight).

Add “How the score works” modal explaining factors/weights and ruleset version.

After you post the artifacts and enable at least one real provider, confirm the public preview URL where I can replicate each step.
