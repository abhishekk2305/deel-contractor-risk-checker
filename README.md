## Known Gaps
Manual QA is tracked in verification_artifacts.md. For full production, I would implement automated tests (unit/integration) around the scoring engine and primary endpoints using Jest and/or Python unittest. Adding a /tests directory and basic test cases is prioritized for future sprints.

- Ready for founder/exec review, feedback, and MVP pilot discussions.

## üí¨ Let‚Äôs Talk

Curious to learn what Deel‚Äôs founders, product, or compliance teams would add, improve, or prioritize further.  
**Open to feedback, discussion, and interview conversations.**

"This is a proof-of-concept hosted on Replit for ease of demonstration; in production, this would be deployed to Deel‚Äôs preferred cloud infra."
