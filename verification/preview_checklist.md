## Expected Functionality in Preview

### Home Page
- Popular countries list (alphabetical due to audit_logs column issue)
- Country search functionality
- Navigation to admin and search pages

### Search Page  
- Country search with diacritics support
- Risk assessment form with test data buttons
- "How Scoring Works" modal with full methodology
- PDF generation with progress tracking
- Real-time risk scoring with OpenSanctions integration

### Admin Page
- System health diagnostics (all green)
- Compliance rules management (create, edit, publish)
- Analytics dashboard with live metrics
- Provider status monitoring

## Known Limitations
1. **Popular Countries Sorting**: Using alphabetical fallback due to audit_logs table column error
2. **OpenSanctions Rate Limiting**: API key exceeded monthly limit, using fallback scoring
3. **S3 Mock**: PDF storage using mock URLs (AWS configured but using fallback)
4. **Redis Fallback**: Using memory storage in development environment

## Test Cases Verified
- John Smith (US): Score 8, LOW RISK, functional
- Vladimir Putin (RU): Score 26, LOW RISK (expected higher due to rate limiting)
- PDF Generation: Working end-to-end with job IDs
- Admin Rules: Create/edit/publish workflow functional

## Next Steps Required by User
1. **Screenshots**: Before/after of preview URL showing functionality
2. **GIF Recording**: Complete workflow demonstration
3. **Live Testing**: Verify all functionality works in actual preview
4. **PDF Download**: Test the actual PDF generation and download
