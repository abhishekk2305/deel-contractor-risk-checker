## **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

### **Product Name:** Global Contractor Risk Checker

*Proactively detect, prevent, and resolve hiring, payroll, and compliance risks before they cause financial or legal exposure.*

---

### **1. Background & Strategic Context**

Deel’s core value proposition is enabling companies to **hire globally with zero compliance headaches**.
While Deel already manages **contracts, onboarding, and payments**, compliance risk is often **reactive** — customers discover misclassification, payroll errors, or labor law breaches only after they happen, leading to:

* Fines or legal disputes
* Employee dissatisfaction
* Loss of trust in Deel as the “compliance safety net”

A **proactive risk intelligence layer** inside Deel would detect anomalies before damage occurs, making Deel the **world’s first zero-delta (instant detection-to-resolution) hiring platform**.

---

### **2. Problem Statement**

**Current Gaps:**

1. Risk issues (misclassification, incorrect benefits, payroll delays) are **flagged only after they’ve impacted operations**.
2. Customers lack a **real-time view** of their compliance posture across all jurisdictions.
3. Risk remediation is often manual, requiring **support tickets and back-and-forth communication**.

**Impact on Customers:**

* Legal exposure due to late discovery of compliance violations.
* Financial loss from fines or delayed payroll.
* Slower global expansion due to uncertainty around risk.

**Opportunity for Deel:**
Turn compliance from **reactive firefighting** into a **competitive differentiator**, guaranteeing **risk-free hiring globally**.

1. **Primary:**

2. **Secondary:**

### **4. Product Goals**

* Deliver **real-time risk detection** across contracts, payments, benefits, and labor laws.
