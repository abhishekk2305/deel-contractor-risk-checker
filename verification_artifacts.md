# Global Contractor Risk Checker - Production Verification Artifacts

**Generated:** August 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

The Global Contractor Risk Checker is a production-ready application built for Deel to assess contractor risks across international markets. The system integrates real-time external data providers with a sophisticated risk scoring algorithm to deliver accurate, compliant risk assessments.

## ✅ Core Functionality Verification

### Risk Assessment Engine ✅
- **Multi-factor scoring algorithm**: 45% sanctions, 15% PEP, 15% adverse media, 15% internal history, 10% country baseline
- **Real-time provider integration**: ComplyAdvantage (sanctions/PEP), NewsAPI (adverse media)
- **Three-tier classification**: Low (<30), Medium (30-70), High (>70) with contextual recommendations
- **Parallel processing**: Concurrent external API calls with timeout handling and fallback strategies
- **Result caching**: 24-hour expiration with comprehensive metadata

### External Provider Integration ✅
- **ComplyAdvantage API**: Production-ready sanctions and PEP screening with confidence scoring
- **NewsAPI Integration**: Adverse media monitoring with sentiment analysis and article tracking
- **Feature flags**: Environment-based provider selection (`FEATURE_SANCTIONS_PROVIDER`, `FEATURE_MEDIA_PROVIDER`)
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when providers timeout or fail
- **Provider monitoring**: Real-time status tracking and error reporting

### Database & Data Management ✅
- **Seeded database**: 13 countries with comprehensive compliance rules and templates
- **Normalized schema**: Countries, contractors, risk scores, compliance rules, audit logs
- **Performance optimization**: Strategic indexing for fast query execution
- **Data validation**: Zod schemas ensuring type safety and input sanitization
