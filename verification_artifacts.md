```sql
SELECT actor, action, entity, created_at FROM audit_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

**Results:**
- `pdf_generate` - PDF generation tracked
- `risk_check_success` - Risk assessment completion logged  
- `search_submit` - Country searches tracked with metadata
- All events include detailed metadata (country, contractor name, risk tier)

## Data Flow Verification

### End-to-End Risk Assessment Flow
1. **User searches country** → Analytics tracking + DB query
2. **User selects country** → Risk assessment form displayed
3. **User submits assessment** → Contractor created + Risk score calculated 
4. **System returns results** → Risk tier, recommendations, penalty range
5. **User requests PDF** → Background job initiated
6. **All actions logged** → Audit trail maintained
